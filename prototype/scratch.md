actions: cost dice or tokens


list of things we have
* tokens
* actions
    * basic actions: movement, damage, throw, grapple, open the path, a challenger approaches, put it out!, Bring it on!, Rescue
        * X: Movement -> gain X speed Tokens
* archetypes
* style
* forms
* stances
* bonuses
* penalties


If we ignore everything except what we need to implement the basic actions everyone has.  we need

action pool (dice), actions, health, range, position, tokens, obstacles, 

if we only implement the move action we still need
action pool, actions, tokens, position.

## Introduction

### Game Summary Pitch

Panic at the portal is a simple Turn based RPG trying to implement the panic at the dojo ttrpg in a video game form. 

### Inspiration!![[247607-988351344.png]]
Panic at the Dojo

Panic at the dojo is a table top roleplaying game (TTRPG) built around the action of fighting games. 

  

### Player Experience

Players will choose a character and undergo a bit of light dialogue before engaging in a series of battle encounters. They may gain progress for a base within a run and potentially meta-progress for their character between runs. 

  

### Platform

The game is developed to be released on windows PC

### Development Software

- Ursina for programming
    
- Game Character Hub and Gimp for graphics and UI
    

  

### Genre

Singleplayer, rpg, tactics

  

### Target Audience

The game is marketed towards fans of tactics games like xcom or final fantasy tactics. And fans of Rogue-likes.

  

## Concept

### Gameplay overview

The player controls a mass of player cells, each with individual status, but moves as a collective. Individual cells may die or be created which influences the total shape of the mass. By navigating through each level, the player must strategically manipulate the shape of the mass to be able to pass around or through obstacles to reach the goal. 

  

### Theme Interpretation (Sacrifice Is Strength)

‘Sacrifice’ interpretation - The player voluntarily offers something they would otherwise use to their benefit to then gain something else of use in its stead.

  

Within the context of a puzzle game, rather than a sacrifice strictly being an optional upgrade of sorts, the timing, placement, and orientation a ‘sacrifice’ within this game instead occurs to allow the solution or progression of the puzzle. Only through careful planning of movement to remove parts of the player’s mass can the player make their way to the exit. One must often sacrifice a part of the player mass to pass through specific areas as they may be too large or encompass the wrong shape.

## Art

### Theme Interpretation

While maintaining the very limited color palette theme, the sole use of black in white seems way too common, and a bit harsh as a color scheme for a relaxing puzzle game. To circumvent this, a soft, dark blue color will act as the unique accent color as opposed to black with white being the primary, carrying color to base the sprites off of.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcTnl5HOkv5QrWmbMUcyU2mckR-IttzOMaMqPzAg3d44w1tS_4yrjxDTCXwYItxop8S0LSq8yKgQF3dd3rrTcPwTG8z11kmSPgqr5RcdSFjHfE4VipbMlH0oocuyTTfcj7-bZr-2wrP2WJoSw17d__pdPFP?key=OcpceFoFnYcEWUxckRWtmg)

  

### Design

A very minimalistic approach will go into the design of the game, heavily relying on the severe contrast of the limited colors to provide detail. Though, the design still is clean and smooth in the sense that, the use of many shades of a color will not be as present to confront the retro style and pixel art.

*Not an actual puzzle/level, merely a full example of the tileset and art style*

  

## Audio

### Music

To add to the overall theme and vibe of the game, there will be minimalism incorporated into the music. Heavy use of reverb and effects to fill space within the few instruments. Bass and drums will generally constitute the majority of tracks with accompanying softer sounds. Mainly through synthesized sounds rather than acoustic will further suggest the retro style.

### Sound Effects

To add more flare and polish to the experience, a multitude of environmental sound effects will give weight and feedback to the player’s actions. Rather than foley, or otherwise realistic sounds, synthesized blips, bloops, and whooshes are used.

  

## Game Experience

### UI

On top of the rigid pixel art constituting the rest of the art, a more smooth, higher definition style will be incorporated in the UI. Utilizing many shades of white and black allowed in the art restriction, anti-aliasing is used to further emphasize the UI.

### Controls

Keyboard

Arrow keys / WASD  
Gamepad

Dpad
